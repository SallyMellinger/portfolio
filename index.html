<p id = "aboutMe">I was working for Tinuiti, one of the largest media + digital agencies in North America as their Content Operations Manager. It was a dream job with perks to-die-for, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I <i>needed</i> to learn web development. It had been an interest of mine since I was a kid, and dabbling in Wordpress HTML and CSS to fix minor website issues at my job just wasn't cutting it. <br><br>
    To rid myself the possibility of a lifetime of 'what-ifs,' I decided to take the leap and enroll at Eleven Fifty Academy in Fishers, Indiana.
    <br><br>
    Since jumping ship and diving head first into web development, I'm realizing web development complements my digital marketing and content writing skills perfectly. That is to say, there is magic in both writing the content and then having the ability to bring those words to life on a webpage that I've designed and developed with marketing and SEO best-practices in mind.<br><br>
I can't wait to finish up my web development certification at Eleven Fifty Academy and bring my content and digital marketing expertise and web development skill set to my next opportunity.

<h1 id="resumeTitle">Experience</h1>
<p id="experience">I'm a Content and Digital Marketing Manager turned Web Developer with a strong SEO background. In my previous positions, I specialized in developing and optimizing internal content marketing project flows to reduce friction, achieve team milestones, and meet overall company content goals. My hands-on experience with SEO, paid search, social media, email marketing, and content marketing provided me unique insight into project prioritization and a deep understanding of how all marketing channels work together to achieve campaign objectives. <br><br>
My return to school to learn Web Development was fueled by my desire to enhance my marketing skill set. I've always loved the process of bringing my content to life on a well-designed website, but was often frustrated by my lack of understanding of <i>how</i> those websites and apps were created. Once I complete my web development courses in December 2020, I'll be a well-rounded marketer with both the creative abilities and technical know-how to help brands bring their marketing ideas to life.
